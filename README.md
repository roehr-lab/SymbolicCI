# cgcCALC
Symbolic Calculator for Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients.

- cgcCALC can be used to generate all the possible Eigenvectors for a coupled system (j1 + j2).
- Generate LaTex file to store the output results.

# Files:
 
The gzipped tarred file (cgcCALC.tar.gz) will produce a directory cgcCALC with several subdirectories.
The created directory is called the Main directory in the remainder.
The Main directory contains the files Doxyfile, README, and a Makefile.
The subdirectory doc contains the documentation generated using DOXYGEN. 
The subdirectory include contains all the needed header files. 
The subdirectory src contains the source files. 
The test subdirectory contains the main example program. The subdirectory output shall store the LaTex file that one of the options within the main program can produce.

# Example: make main
In order build the main executable file, run the make file: "make main" or just "make" on your terminal.

# Documentation 
You can generate the documentation files using the "Doxyfile" in the main directory. ( doxygen Doxyfile)
